## Key Implementation Details

1.  **Landing Page (`/app/page.tsx`)**: The main page presents the e-book offer and contains the registration form (`EbookForm`).
2.  **Registration Form (`/components/ebook-form/index.tsx`)**: A client-side component that collects user data (name, email, WhatsApp) and submits it to the API endpoint.
3.  **Email API (`/app/api/send-ebook/route.tsx`)**: A Next.js API route that uses the Resend SDK to send the e-book PDF as an attachment to the user's email. It logs the registration data to the console.
4.  **Theme Management (`/context/index.tsx`)**: Uses `next-themes` to provide dark/light mode support.
5.  **Styling (`tailwind.config.ts`)**: Extensive Tailwind configuration for custom colors and typography.
